# Dough Sniper
This is the old name sniper I used to use to catch OG Names while trades were happening. It was insanely fast and made by myself &amp; doc. doc is a friend of mine.


# Important Information

> Firstly, this is made in a special programming langauage called Fullic. It's created by my friends for me and my friend group. You will not be able to use it but only the exe file.
> Secondly, this name sniper is DEPRECATED and doesn't work due to a lost of interest and I've also retried from the OG name community. You can read the source or try to learn Fullic from what you can see. I just put this on here because it could be interesting.

The name sniping part doesn't work anymore due to some API stuff that I don't know anything about.
